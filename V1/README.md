# V2
This is the precursor to my tie fighter Vs X-wing game, a stepping stone between my 10th grade physical game project, made with C++ and Arduino, Re-implimented using Pygame.<br/>
Use arrows to move the Top Player back and forth and the up or down arrows to shoot. <br/>
Use "a" and "d" to move the Bottom Player. Use "w" or "s" to shoot.<br/>
